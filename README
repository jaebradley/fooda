# Fooda Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Where my food at?

#### Installation
* Install the Fooda CLI using Node Package Manager (NPM) by typing `npm install fooda -g` into your terminal.

#### Commands
* To see what's cooking at a specific location, type `fooda menu {location}`.
* For example, `fooda menu davenport` returns the menu for the Davenport building, today.
* Currently, the only supported location options are `davenport` and `hubspot` (I know, I know). I get to why a bit later.

### Moar Background Information

#### Why is this service so limited?
* Full disclosure: when creating this CLI, I worked at HubSpot, so from a completely selfish perspective, I cared about what the Fooda options were near me.
* Fooda doesn't have an API, so I am generating menu information by scraping their website.
* Given the lack of an API, and that Fooda's url structuring is not completely obvious, programmatically supporting multiple locations is a bit more challenging.

#### Why did you create this really limited service?
* Fooda wasn't doing a very good job of emailing me what options were available for a given day, and I hate leaving the command line, if I don't have to (because I'm lazy as fuck #millenialproblems).
